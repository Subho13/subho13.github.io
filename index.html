        <h1>Subhojyoti Khastagir</h1>
        <h2>PhD, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</h2>


        <p>Subhojyoti Khastagir <em>aka Subho</em> is a research scholar, pursuing PhD at the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. He is working under the guidance of Dr. Niloy Ganguly and Dr. Pawan Goyal, and is a member of <a href="https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/">CNeRG</a>. His interests are in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, with a particular focus on Graph Machine Learning and Generative AI models.</p>

        <p>Subho received his M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institue of Science Bangalore, supervised by <a href="https://www.shishirny.com/">Dr. Shishir Kolathaya</a>. He received his B.Tech degree in Information Technology from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology Shibpur.</p>

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Graph Machine Learning</li>
            <li>Generative AI (diffusion models, autoencoders)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Graphs have the agility to represent a variety of problems that exist in society. I would like to not only look into ways of devising better and richer representations of real world problems in terms of graphs, but also to find innovative solutions and ways of approaching the problems. I am especially interested in applications like discovery of novel materials, molecules and drugs.</p>
        <p>I am also eager to learn more about generative AI and the ways in which AI can improve quality of life. I wish to contribute a drop of my meager knowledge to the development of mankind as a whole.</p>
